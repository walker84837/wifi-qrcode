## Known issues

Here are some known issues that we're working on fixing:

- The QR code generator sometimes generates two codes on the first try, and generates a new one without removing the old ones.
- Users can't currently customize the size of the QR code.
- We need to ensure that the website works well on a variety of devices and browsers.

While not critical, we also plan to improve the accessibility of the form for users with disabilities.
